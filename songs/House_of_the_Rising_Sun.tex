1. There \C{Am}is a \C{C}house in \C{D}New Orleans~\C{F}
They \C{Am}call the \C{C}Rising \C{E}Sun~\C{E}
And it's bee\C{Am}n the \C{C}ruin of \C{D}many a poor boy~\C{F}
And \C{Am}God I \C{E}know I'm \C{Am}one~\C{E}

In the \C{Am}House of \C{E}Rising Su\C{Am}n~\C{E}

Well, I've g\C{Am}ot one \C{C}foot on the \C{D}platform~\C{F}

to \C{Am}wear that \C{E}ball and \C{Am}chain~\C{E / C D F Am E Am E}

Well, there \C{Am}is a \C{C}house in \C{D}New Orlean\C{F}s

And it's bee\C{Am}n the \C{C}ruin of \C{D}many a poor boy~\C{F}
And \C{Am}God I \C{E}know I'm \C{Am}one~\C{E}
